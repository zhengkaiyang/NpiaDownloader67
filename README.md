## 🚀 Usage

To download paid chapters, you'll need a `LOGINKEY`. You can get it by logging into your Novelpia account in a web browser, opening the developer tools (F12), and navigating to the **Storage** tab. Copy the value of your `LOGINKEY` from there.
*(You must have access to the content that you intend to download on your account.)*

A higher thread count and a lower interval can speed up your downloads, but be aware that this increases the risk of an IP ban.
*(Going above 10 threads can cause the website to rate-limit you, resulting in chapters failing to download and eventually a 24-48 hour IP ban.)*

## 💾 Space-Saving Tips

### Image Compression

Built-in image compression can dramatically reduce file size. Use the `-compressimages` and `-jpegquality` arguments to enable this feature. (Or the checkbox)

  - **80% Quality:** Provides large savings with no noticeable quality difference (e.g., 1MB -\> 65KB).
  - **50% Quality:** Offers massive savings with only a small difference in quality (e.g., 1MB -\> 30KB).
  - **10-30% Quality:** For extreme savings, though the quality difference will be noticeable (e.g., 1MB -\> \<10KB).

### Post-Processing with Calibre

For even greater space savings (10-50%), you can use the Calibre EPUB editor. Converting and saving a new `.epub` file with Calibre optimizes the CSS, HTML, and embedded fonts. This is a manual step, as implementing these optimizations directly is currently outside the scope of this project.

## 🛠️ Command-Line Arguments

The NovelpiaDownloader can be operated directly from the command line, ideal for automated and scripted downloads.

*(Keep the table of arguments and usage examples exactly as you have them, they are very clear and well-formatted.)*

## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

Here are some solutions to common problems you might encounter.

**Q: I'm getting an error that says I'm not logged in, but I've entered my LOGINKEY.**
A: Ensure your `LOGINKEY` is still valid. Novelpia keys expire after a period of time. Try logging out and back in on the website, then get a new `LOGINKEY` from the storage tab and use that. Make sure you click the "Log In" button in the application.

**Q: The download process seems to be stuck or is extremely slow.**
A: This could be due to a temporary IP ban from Novelpia's servers, which can happen with a high thread count. Try the following:

1.  Reduce your thread count and increase the interval in the settings.
2.  If the problem persists, wait for a few hours and try again, as the IP ban is usually temporary.
3.  Check your network connection.

**Q: The downloaded file is missing chapters or content.**
A: Double-check the `-from` and `-to` arguments to make sure they cover the desired chapter range. Ensure you have a valid `LOGINKEY` for any paid chapters. Lastly, make sure your account has access to the content you are downloading.

**Q: How do I find the `Novel ID`?**
A: The `Novel ID` is the number in the novel's URL. For example, if the URL is `https://novelpia.com/novel/123456`, the `Novel ID` is `123456`.

**Q: My EPUB reader is throwing errors when I try to open the EPUB.**
A: This can be caused by missing chapters (e.g., R19 chapters being skipped due to account permissions). The easiest fix is to open the EPUB in [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download) (an open-source e-book & EPUB manager) and convert it to a new EPUB file. This can be done in bulk.

**Q: Epub fails to load still**
A: Use Moon+ Reader, ReadEra, or Calibre. Lithium and some other readers may not work, but this will be fixed in a future update.
